# Navigation effects

## Description
This project is a webpage demonstrating various effects and functionalities, including a responsive navigation bar with scroll events and transition effects.

## Features
- Navigation Bar: A flexible navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes. It includes a logo, navigation links, and a button.
- Scroll Events: As users interact with the webpage, the navigation bar reacts to their scrolling behavior. It gradually disappears when the user scrolls down and reappears when the user scrolls up.
- Color Transitions: At specific scroll positions, the navigation bar changes color. It becomes transparent when it's near the top of the page and turns black as the user scrolls further down.
